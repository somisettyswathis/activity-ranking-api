# activity-ranking-api
This repository contains the QA deliverables for the Activity Ranking API feature, including manual test design, BDD scenarios, and automated test scripts using Cypress.

#feature Summary
Description:
As a user, I want to enter a city or town name and receive a ranked list of activities

Skiing, Surfing, Outdoor Sightseeing,

Indoor Sightseeing) for the next 7 days, based on weather conditions.
As I type in the search box, I should also see autocomplete suggestions for matching cities or towns to help me complete
my query faster.

Acceptance Criteria:
The API accepts a city or town name as input.
It fetches 7-day weather data using Open-Meteo APIs.
It ranks each day for each activity based on weather suitability.
The response includes:
Date
Activity name
Rank
1
10
Reasoning (e.g., "High snowfall expected", "Clear skies and 22Â°C")
The search box provides autocomplete suggestions as the user types.
Suggestions are based on a predefined or dynamic list of cities.
Selecting a suggestion triggers the activity ranking request.
